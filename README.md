Daily journal to log my learnings


## Thursday 20th October 2022

Today I started a Daily Diary for my learnings.

## Friday 21st October 2022

Today I started to experiment with DOM manipulation and incoporating JS into my web pages.

Tommorrow I plan to:
- Finish the design of my Hobby Page (HTML & CSS)
- Create a repository for the Hobby page
- Start using DOM manipulation to finish the last hobby page task.
